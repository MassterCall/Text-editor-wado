# ⌨️ Text-editor-wado
A personal journey to build a simple, lightweight text editor in C from scratch. 🚀

📝 About This Project
The goal is to create a functional, terminal-based text editor. This project starts with the very basics: getting raw, unbuffered input from the user, one keystroke at a time.

✨ Current Features
Raw Mode Enabled 🕹️: The terminal's canonical mode is disabled, allowing the program to process each keystroke as it happens. No need to press Enter!

Keystroke Reading 🖱️: It reads and displays the ASCII value of every key you press, giving insight into how the terminal handles input.

Safe Exit 🚪: The program exits cleanly when you press q and safely restores the original terminal settings.
